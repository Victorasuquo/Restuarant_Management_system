## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The existing restaurant management systems lack an efficient and well-structured design that incorporates key functionalities such as menu management, order taking, and bill calculation. These systems often suffer from a lack of proper encapsulation and inheritance, resulting in a complex and difficult-to-maintain codebase. Therefore, there is a need to design and develop a restaurant management system that addresses these shortcomings and provides an intuitive and robust solution for restaurant owners and staff.

The problem at hand is to create a user-friendly restaurant management system that utilizes the principles of inheritance and encapsulation to model the relationships between different components of the system. The system should include classes such as Restaurant, Menu, and Order to effectively manage menus, facilitate order-taking, and accurately calculate bills. By implementing this system, it will streamline restaurant operations, enhance efficiency, and improve the overall dining experience for customers.


## RESTUARANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

A Restuarant Management System is a type of Point-of-sales (POS) Software that is specifically designed for Restuarants, bars, foodtrucks and others in the FoodService Industry. Unlike Point of sales, Restuarant Management System encompasses all Backend needs such as inventory an staff management, etc. A Restuarant Mangement Sytems or Softwares are intended to assist leaders and others in carrying out the most critical Management tasks.

A System of this type may be a comprehensive all-in-one solution, including elements of a Point-of-Sales System, such as payment Processing, with more complex back-end features such as workforce management, inventory management, and a booking or Reservation System. 
However some Restuarant Management system Focuses on some Specific Task 

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project presents a comprehensive restaurant management system that has been designed and developed, utilizing object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation. The system incorporates various classes, including Restaurant, Menu, and Order, to offer an efficient and user-friendly solution for menu management, order taking, and bill calculation.

In contrast to existing restaurant management systems, which often lack a well-structured design and essential functionalities, this system has addressed those limitations. It provides a robust and intuitive solution that can streamline restaurant operations and enhance the overall dining experience for customers.

 ### The key features of the restaurant management system include:

#### Menu Management:
The system allows easy management of menus, enabling restaurant owners and staff to effortlessly add, update, and remove menu items. It supports effective categorization and organization of items, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable menu browsing experience.

#### Order Taking: 
The system offers an efficient interface for staff to take customer orders. It handles various order types, such as dine-in, takeout, and delivery, with accurate recording of order details. Staff can capture menu items, quantities, and any specific customer preferences or modifications seamlessly.

#### Bill Calculation: 
The system accurately calculates bills based on the placed orders, taking into account item prices, additional charges or discounts, and applicable taxes. It generates itemized bills for customers, facilitating a hassle-free payment process.

#### Inheritance and Encapsulation:
 The system incorporates the principles of inheritance and encapsulation, creating a modular and maintainable codebase. This enables easy expansion and customization as per specific business requirements.

By leveraging this restaurant management system, restaurant owners and staff can benefit from improved efficiency in menu management, order taking, and bill calculation. The system streamlines operations, reduces errors, and contributes to an enhanced dining experience for customers.


## USES AND BENEFITS OF A RESTUARNAT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Such as it enables you to create information on daily food consumption and waste. Additionally, it will monitor the food's expiration dates to ensure that only fresh ingredients are being utilized.


### WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF A GOOD RESTURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The best Restuarant Management system will share similar traits and features, including the following:	
    * __cloud Based__
    * __Reporting and Analytics__
    * __Additional Integrations__
    * __Technical Support__
    * __aLL-in-one solution__
    * __User-friendliness__
    * __Intuitive menu Configuration__

Use inheritance and encapsulation to model relationships between different components of the system.



## THE CHALENGES
* The challenges i had was understanding the ipmpletation of this concepts as well as where, how, why and whenn to use them.
I solved this problem by going back to the review resources online.

* The program was rerturning the storage location of an object, but taht was'nt really usefull. 

* The food items wrapped to a particular menu.  



### LESSONS LEARNED ##
* I have learnt that before the you write a An Objet Orinted Program especially when involves more methods and classes, it is important to bring a chair, seat down like you want to select beans and draw to the model and flow of the program. This will help give you direction and save time of thinking about what to do.
